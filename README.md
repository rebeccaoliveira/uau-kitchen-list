# Uau-Kitchen-Project

As I'm currently living remote, I decided to create a simple app to help to organize weekly meals and shopping list, before to go to the supermarket.

## The plan

1. To create a simple "to do" list.
2. Save recipes with favorites foods.
3. Use a calendar to organize a weekly meals.
4. Create Dashboard with basics information.


## The work process for To do List (v.0.1)

1. [x] set up a new app using [React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
2. [x] to create components from zero (even this components already exist in some open source project)
3. [x] thinking in UI / UX, use the component created before and apply [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
4. [x] beautify with CSS using [JSS](http://cssinjs.org/)
5. [x] add test to components
6. [ ] create an API
7. [ ] add build on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)

## The work process for To do List (v.0.2)
1. [ ] use Redux do separate states of this new component


### Important:
Commit on Git every new change during the process.
