# Uau-Kitchen-List

As I'm currently living remote, I decided to create a simple app to do list, to help me to organize my weekly shopping list, before to go to the supermarket.

## The plan

To create a simple "to do" list, where is possible to insert products to buy or remove giving up to buy some product.


## The work process

1. [x] set up a new app using [React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
2. [x] to create components from zero (even this components already exist in some open source project)
3. [ ] thinking in UI / UX, use the component created before and apply [Rectstrapp](https://reactstrap.github.io/) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
4. [ ] beautify with CSS using [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
5. [ ] add test to components
6. [ ] add build on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
7. [ ] publish on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
